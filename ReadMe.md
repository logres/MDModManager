# MDModManager
A MD Mod Manager developed in python and PySimpleGUI.

## Features

- [x] Mod browse, create(combine resources to a mod), delete, apply and reset.
- [x] Resources browse, create, delete, apply and reset.
- [ ] ???

## Usage

Now I have't packaged it, so you need to run it by yourself.

1. clone this repo
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python -m game_resource_manager
4. choose your local_resource_dir and game_resource_dir

you can download mod file yourself and import it to the manager, or I could provide some local_resource_dir.zip for you.

I will package it in the future.
